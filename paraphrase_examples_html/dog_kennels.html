    
    <strong>Context:</strong> A database about dogs and owners as well as the record of the treatments each dog has had.<br> Each treatment includes the treatment type, the professional (who did the treatment to the dog), date and cost.<br><br>
    Below are 2 good examples: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Tell me the owner id and last name of the owner who spent the most on treatments of his or her dogs. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> who spent the most on treatments of their dogs? Show me the id and last name. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> Show me owner id and last name of owner who spent the most on dog care. <br><br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Which professionals have done the most number of treatments? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Which professionals are the most experienced? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> Who has held at least five concerts? <br><br>

    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Tell me the owner id and last name of the owner who spent the most on treatments of his or her dogs. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> Tell me the information of the owner who spent the most on treatments of his or her dogs. <br>(It is not a good paraphrase because the <strong>owner id and last name</strong> in the original question is omitted)  <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 2:</strong> Show me owner id and last name of owner whose dogs have the most times of treatments. <br>(It is not a good paraphrase because the original question asks about the most spent (money), and the paraphrase asks about the most number of treatments.) <br><br>
