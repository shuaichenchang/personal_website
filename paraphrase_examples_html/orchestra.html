    Below are 2 good examples: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> What are the names of conductors, ordered by age? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Show me all conductors from the yongest to the oldest. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> List the conductors by their age. <br><br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Return the names of conductors that do not have the nationality "USA".<br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Please list non-American conductors. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> Show all conductors who do not have US nationality. <br><br>

    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Show the names of conductors that have conducted more than one orchestras. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> Which conductors have conducted at least one orchestras?  (It is not a good paraphrase because <strong>more than one (excluding 1)</strong> does not mean the same as <strong>at least one (including 1)</strong>) <br><br>
