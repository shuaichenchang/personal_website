    Below are 2 good examples: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Find the first name and age of students who have a dog but do not have a cat as a pet. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Who has a dog but no cat? Tell me their first names and ages. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> List the first name and age of students who have a dog but not a cat <br><br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Find number of pets owned by students who are older than 20. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> For people older than 20 how many pets do they have? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> How many pets are owned by students over 20? <br><br>

    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Find number of pets owned by students who are older than 20. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> How many pets are owned by 20 year old or older?  (It is not a good paraphrase because the original question is asking <strong>older than 20 (excluding 20)</strong> and the praphrase is <strong>20 or older (including 20)</strong>.)  <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 2:</strong> What are the total number of pets? (It is not a good paraphrase because <strong>student over 20 years old</strong> is omited) <br><br>
