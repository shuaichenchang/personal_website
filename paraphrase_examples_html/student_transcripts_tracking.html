    
    <strong>Context:</strong> A school system database including course arrangement, students' enrollment and students' transcripts. <br><br>
    Below are 2 good examples: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> What are the descriptions for all the math courses? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Describe the available math courses. <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Show the date and id of the transcript with at least 2 course results. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> For transcripts containing two of more courses, what are their date and ID? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> For transcripts containing no less than 2 courses, list their date and ID. <br><br>

    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Show the date and id of the transcript with at least 2 course results. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> For transcripts containing more than 2 courses, what are their date and ID?  (It is not a good paraphrase because the at least 2 (including 2) and more than 2 (excluding 2) don't mean the exact same thing.)  <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 2:</strong>What transcripts have more or equal to 2 results? (It is not a good paraphrase because the original question asks for <strong>id and date</strong> that is omitted in the paraphrase.) <br><br>
