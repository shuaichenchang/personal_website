    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Find the names of loser and winner who played in the match with greatest number of minutes. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> Find the information of loser and winner who played in the longest match.  (It is not a good paraphrase because the original question asks for <strong>names</strong>. <strong>information</strong> in the paraphrase is too vague.)  <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 2:</strong> Who are the loser and winner played in the match that lasted the shortest? (It is not a good paraphrase because the original questions asks about the <strong>longest</strong> game and the paraphrase is about the <strong>shortest</strong> game.) <br><br>
