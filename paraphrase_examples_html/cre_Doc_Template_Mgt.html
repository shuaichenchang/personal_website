    
    <strong>Context:</strong> A database containing template information, document information and paragraphes in documents. <br><br>
    Below are 2 good examples: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Show ids for all templates not used by any document. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> What are the IDs for templates not associated with a document? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> which temples not used any document? what are the ids of those templates <br><br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Return the lowest version number, along with its corresponding template type code. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> What is the earliest version and its template type code? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> what is the lowest version number as well as its corresponding model type code? <br><br>

    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Return the lowest version number, along with its corresponding template type code. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> What's the template type code with the lowest version number?  (It is not a good paraphrase because the original question asks for <strong>lowest version number and template type code</strong> and the paraphrase question only asks to return the template type code)  <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 2:</strong> What's the template type code with the lowest version number?  (It is not a good paraphrase because <strong>template code</strong> doesn't mean the same thing as <strong>template type code</strong>) <br><br>
