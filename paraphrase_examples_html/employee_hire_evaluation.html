    
    <strong>Context:</strong> A database containing the information about shops and their employees as well as hiring and evaluation records. <br><br>
    Below are 2 good examples: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Find the districts in which there are both shops selling less than 3000 products and shops selling more than 10000 products. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Which districts have both shops selling fewer than 3K products as well as shops selling greater than 10K products? <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> What are the list of districts where shops sales less than 3,000 products and more than 10,000 produstcs? <br><br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Find the names of employees who never won any award in the evaluation. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Who never won any award in the evaluation find the name of the employees. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> show me the name of employees without any evaluation awards. <br><br>

    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Find the districts in which there are both shops selling less than 3000 products and shops selling more than 10000 products. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> Which districts have both shops selling fewer than 3K products? (It is not a good paraphrase because the <strong>more than 10000 products</strong> in the original question is omitted)  <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 2:</strong> Which districts have both shops selling more than 3K products as well as shops selling less than 10K products? <br>(It is not a good paraphrase because the originial questions ask a districts with <strong> a store sells more than 10K</strong> and <strong>another store less than 3K</strong> but the paraphrase is asking more than 3K and less than 10K) <br><br>
