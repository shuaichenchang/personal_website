    
    <strong>Context:</strong> A database about high school students containing the information about if two students are friends and if a student likes another student. <br><br>
    Below are 2 good examples: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Show the names of high school students and their corresponding number of friends. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> List all students and how many friends they have. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> Show a list of high school students along with their number of freinds. <br><br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Return the name of the high school student with the most friends. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 1:</strong> Which student is the most friendly in high school. <br>
    <strong>Good Paraphrase 2:</strong> Which high school student has the most friends? <br><br>

    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> Show me all grades that have at least 4 students. <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> Show me all grades that there are more than 4 students have.  (It is not a good paraphrase because <strong>at least 4 (including 4)</strong> does not mean the same as <strong>more than 4 (excluding 4)</strong>) <br><br>
