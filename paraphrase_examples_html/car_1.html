    Below are a bad example: <br>
    <strong>Question:</strong> What are the names and ids of all makers with more than 3 models? <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 1:</strong> What makers have more than 3 models?  (It is not a good paraphrase because the <strong>show names and ids</strong> in the original question is omitted)  <br>
    <strong>Bad Paraphrase 2:</strong> What are the names and ids of all makers with at least 3 models? (It is not a good paraphrase because <strong>more than 3</strong> is different from <strong>at least 3</strong>) <br><br>
